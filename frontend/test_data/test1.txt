Meeting: Daily Standup - Project Nova UI
Date: October 2, 2025
Attendees: Team Alpha (Chair: Elena), Alex, Mark, Sarah

Elena: Status check. Alex, what's your update?
Alex: Yesterday, I completed the new user profile page (Feature #401). Testing revealed a minor issue where the avatar upload spinner stays visible after success. It's a low-priority bug (Bug #408) which I'll address this afternoon. Today's goal is to start the integration of the payment gateway API.
Mark: I finished all backend API documentation for the reporting module. I did find that the 'total users' endpoint is incorrectly calculating based on unique IPs rather than user IDs. This is a P1 issue (Bug #409). I am fixing it now. ETA: 2 hours.
Sarah: No major blockers. Completed the responsive design adjustments for the dashboard. I also spent two hours helping Mark with the documentation review. This sprint commitment is solid.
Decision: Mark to escalate Bug #409 fix before any other work. Alex to delay payment gateway integration until Bug #408 is resolved.
Action Items:
1. Mark: Fix Bug #409 (Total Users Miscalculation). Due: EOD today.
2. Alex: Fix Bug #408 (Avatar Spinner Issue). Due: Tomorrow morning.
3. Elena: Review Sarah's dashboard design adjustments. Due: EOD tomorrow.
