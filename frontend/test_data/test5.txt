Meeting: Budget Workshop (Part 2)
Date: October 17, 2025
Topic: Parks Budget and Water Rate Hike

CFO Smith: Presented final budget proposal. Total increase of 3.5% over last year. Main driver: new software for tax collection.
Parks Director (Ms. Hayes): Requested an additional $200k for the Parks & Rec division. Specifically, to hire 3 new seasonal maintenance workers and start a free summer arts program for kids. Council seemed receptive to the arts program part.
Councilman Kim: Asked CFO Smith if the budget could absorb the $200k without raising property taxes.
CFO Smith: No. It would require a **2% increase in the residential water usage fee** (averaging $5/month per household) to cover the $200k for parks.
Public Comment (Sarah C.): Called the water fee increase "unacceptable." Said the city should cut spending on the new City Hall fountain instead. Fountain cost $80k.
Councilwoman Patel: Proposed an amendment to **fund the summer arts program ($75k) by diverting funds from the fountain reserve**, leaving the remaining parks request and water fee increase off the table for now.
Councilman Kim: Seconds Patel's motion.
Vote: 5-0 unanimous approval for the amendment.

Action Items:
1. CFO Smith: Adjust budget to fund $75k summer arts program from City Hall fountain reserve. Due: Pre-council vote next week.
2. Parks Director: Begin planning for the summer arts program.
